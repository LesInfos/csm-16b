\begin{enumerate}

\qitem \textbf{Conceptual Question:} What are the advantages of a system in Controllable Canonical Form? Is it possible to convert any system into Controllable Canonical Form?

\qitem \textbf{Conceptual Question:} What is the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem and what is its importance to explaining a system's controllability?

\sol{
When $S_1$ is on and $S_2$ is off for a long period of time, $\frac{di_L}{dt} = 0$ because the circuit will have reached a steady state, and the current through $R_1$ will be equal to $i_L$. We find
$$V_{in} - V_L - V_{R_1} = 0$$
$$V_{in} - L\frac{di_L}{dt}(0) - i_L(0)R_1 = 0$$
$$V_{in} - i_L(0)R_1 = 0$$
$$i_L(0) = \frac{V_{in}}{R_1}$$

\qitem Consider the following discrete time system:

$$\vec{x}[n+1] = A\vec{x}[n] + Bu[n] = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & -j & -1 & j \\
1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\
1 & j & -1 & -j \\
\end{bmatrix} \vec{x}[n] + \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
0 \\
0 \\
0 \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot u[n]
$$

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is the system controllable? Explain why or why not.
	\item Is the system stable? Prove that it is or give a counterexample?
\end{enumerate}
