\section{Moore's Law}

\qcontributor{Regina Eckert}

Moore's Law is a 1965 observation by Fairchild Semiconductor Research and Development Lab's director, Gordon Moore, that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit chip doubles every 1.5-2 years. This observation has dominated the computer industry into modern day, where we now have sophisticated processes to create transistors that have a smallest feature size that is 10 \si{\nano\meter} across.
