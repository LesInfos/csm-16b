\qns{Filter Design}
\qcontributor{Maxwell Chen}

Suppose you have been hired to design a biomedical sensor that can detect and output recordings of Alpha brainwaves in the frequency range $8 \, \text{Hz}$ to $13 \, \text{Hz}$. 
Unfortunately, our sensor is faulty: it is also picking up Gamma brainwaves in the frequency range $32 \, \text{Hz}$ to $100 \, \text{Hz}$, interfering with our ability to get clean recordings of alpha brainwaves. 
We want to create a new design for our sensor that can remove this interference, giving us a clearer signal.

\begin{enumerate}

	\qitem What kind of filter could you use to remove this interference? 
    
    \sol { 
    We should use a low-pass filter. The interference is at a higher frequency than our desired signal, so we filter out the higher frequencies and keep the lower frequencies.
    }
	
	\qitem Assume we only have access to resistors and capacitors. \textbf{Sketch the corresponding filter circuit and write out its transfer function.} 

	\sol {
	$$H(\omega) = \frac{\widetilde{Z_{out}}}{\widetilde{Z_{in}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{j\omega C}}{R + \frac{1}{j \omega C}} = \frac{1}{1 + j\omega RC} = \frac{1}{1 + j \frac{\omega}{\omega_p}}$$.

	}	

	\qitem $\omega_p = \frac{1}{RC}$ is the pole frequency which determines the frequency at which our filter starts attenuating the signal. \textbf{Should we maximize or minimize $\omega_p$ to remove as much of the interference as possible?}

	\sol {
	We should minimize the pole frequency. The transfer function will start filtering frequencies sooner, meaning that we maximize the amount by which higher frequencies are attenuated.
	}	

	\qitem Say we can set our cutoff frequency to $10 \, \text{Hz}$, $20 \, \text{Hz}$, $32 \, \text{Hz}$, $100 \, \text{Hz}$, or $120 \, \text{Hz}$. Which is the best pole frequency, and why?

	\sol {
	20Hz. This is the lowest pole frequency we can choose; the Gamma brainwaves will be attenuated more if we choose 20Hz than 32Hz because the transfer function will start filtering at a lower frequency. 10Hz is too low and risks cutting off Alpha brainwaves.
	}	

	\qitem We only have a 3.3 k$\Omega$ resistor in our workstation. What capacitor value should we use for our filter?

	\sol {
	If we want a pole frquency of 20Hz, then $f = \frac{\omega_p}{2 \pi} = \frac{1}{2 \pi RC} = 20Hz$. So, $C = \frac{1}{2 \pi \cdot 33 \cdot 10^{3} \Omega \cdot 20Hz} = 2.41 \, \mu$F.
	}	

	\qitem Draw the Bode plot for the magnitude and phase response of this filter.

	\qitem \textbf{(Optional:)} Say that our filter is successful at removing the interference we initially detected. We now notice that there is another source of interference--Delta brainwaves--in the frequency range 0.5Hz to 4Hz. \textbf{How could we modify our design to remove both sources of interference and get a clear recording of Alpha brainwaves?}

	\sol {
	Replace our low-pass filter with a bandpass filter. This will attenuate both sources of noise and leave our frequency band for Alpha brainwaves intact for our sensor to record.
