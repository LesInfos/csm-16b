\begin{enumerate}

\qitem Can you think of a function where $\ddt{y(t)}{t} = y(t)$ for all $t$?

\qitem Now, how can you modify the function above to solve $\ddt{y(t)}{t} + \alpha y(t) = 0$?
This equation is known as the homogenous equation.

\qitem You might notice that the solution above is not unique.
This is the reason a differential equation will often come with an initial condition such as $y(0) = 2$.
Try using this initial condition to solve for a unique solution to the differential equation above.

\qitem Now, let's try solving our original equation:
\begin{align}
    \ddt{y(t)}{t} + \alpha y(t) = \beta
\end{align}.
To do this, we will use a change of variables.
Let $\widetilde{y}(t) = y(t) - \frac{\beta}{\alpha}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\qitem Try writing the original equation as a differential equation in terms of $\widetilde{y}(t)$.
\qitem Does this equation look familiar? How can you solve this equation?
\qitem What is the final solution $y(t)$? Assume $y(0)$ is given.
\end{enumerate}

To recap, given a first order differential equation $\ddt{y(t)}{t} + \alpha y(t) = \beta$, the solution is:
\begin{align}
    y(t) = y(0) e^{-\alpha t} + \frac{\beta}{\alpha} (1 - e^{-\alpha t})
\end{align}

Another form you might find useful is the steady state form:

\begin{align}
    y(t) = y(\infty) + (y(0) - y(\infty)) e^{-\alpha t}
\end{align}

\end{enumerate}
