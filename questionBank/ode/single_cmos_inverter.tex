\qns{RC Transistor Model}

Consider a CMOS inverter with a voltage input, except there is some resistance between the voltage source and the gates of the transistors.

You want to analyze the behavior of this circuit in the time domain, so you decide to look at the gate voltage of the NMOS transistor ($V_{gsn}$) as a function of time.

\begin{enumerate}

\qitem First, we want to model our transistors in terms of resistors and capacitors. \\
A transistor can be modeled as having a capacitor between the gate ans source, and a resistor and a switch between the drain and the source.
