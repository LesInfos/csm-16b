\qns{An Introduction to Linearization}

The majority of the examples seen in 16B so far have used functions that are \textbf{linear}.
A linear function $f(x)$ is a function that satisfies the two following properties:
\begin{align*}
  &\textbf{Scaling:} \ \ f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x) \ \ \text{for any scalar $\alpha.$} \\
  &\textbf{Superposition:} \ \ f(x_{1} + x_{2}) = f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2}) \ \ \text{for any $x_{1}, x_{2}$ in the domain of $f.$}
\end{align*}
Every matrix $A$ can be seen as a linear function $f(\vec{x}) = A \vec{x}$ since $f$ will satisfy both properties above.

In this question however, we will turn our attention to functions that are \textbf{nonlinear}, meaning it will not satisfy both properties above. Some common examples of nonlinear functions are: $\sin(x), x^{2},$ or even $x - 4.$ 
Linear functions are very convenient to work with, and we already have a large tool-kit on how to handle linear systems. 
So ideally, we would like every system to be linear. 

If we can construct a linear approximation for a nonlinear function, then we could use all of our techniques for linear systems to approximate the behavior of a nonlinear system! 
The process of creating a linear approximation for a nonlinear function is called \textbf{linearization.}

The main ideas for linearization will come from Taylor Expansion, in which we'll give a first order approximation for a function as:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:ta}
  f(x) = f(x^{*}) + \frac{f'(x^{*})}{1!} (x - x^{*}) = f(x^{*}) + f'(x^{*}) (x - x^{*})
\end{equation}
\begin{enumerate}
  \qitem Is the function $f(x) = 5x$ linear? Prove why or why not?

  \qitem How about the function $f(x) = e^{x}?$ Prove why it is, or isn't linear.
\end{enumerate}

Let's now take a look at the differential equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:nl}
  \ddt{}{t} x(t) = \sin(x)
\end{equation}
With initial condition, $x(0) = x_{0},$ since $\sin(x)$ is a nonlinear function, this differential equation will be difficult to solve.
Therefore, we will linearize this system by taking an \textbf{equilibrium point} $x^{*}$ and taking a first order Taylor approximation.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \qitem What is the first order Taylor approximation of $f(x) = \sin(x)$ around $x^{*} = 0?$

  \sol {
    Using the first order Taylor expansion formula given in \eqref{eqn:ta}, we get:
    $$f(x) = f(x^{*}) + f'(x^{*}) (x - x^{*})$$
    The derivative of $\sin(x)$ is $\cos(x)$ so plugging in for $x^{*} = 0,$ we get:
    $$f(x) = \sin(0) + \cos(0) (x - 0) = x$$
  }

  \qitem We will now look at a small window of $x(t)$ around $x^{*}$ and let $x(t) = x^{*} + \delta_{x}(t)$ where $\delta_{x}(t)$ is small enough so the error of the Taylor approximation is small. Plug in this $x(t)$ into the original differential equation \eqref{eqn:nl}:

  \sol {
    Plugging in $x(t) = x^{*} + \delta_{x}(t),$ we'll get:
    $$f(x) = x = x^{*} + \delta_{x}(t)$$
    Differentiating $x(t),$ and noticing that $x^{*}$ is a constant (zero in this case), we get:
    $$\ddt{}{t} x(t) = \ddt{}{t} \delta_{x}(t)$$
    Therefore, the differential equation represented by \eqref{eqn:nl} will now be:
    \begin{equation} \label{eqn:nl}
      \ddt{}{t} \delta_{x}(t) = \delta_{x}(t)
    \end{equation}
  }

  \qitem What is the solution to the new differential equation derived in $\delta_{x}(t)$

  \meta {
    It is important to emphasize here that this $\delta_{x}(t)$ is no longer a function of $x$ rather, it is a function of the distance to $x.$
    This however, does not matter since when we are doing system analysis, we rarely care about the actual solution to this system, rather we care about its behavior.
  }

  \sol {
    This is a first order homogenous differential equation, with zero input.
    Therefore, the solution will be:
    \begin{equation} \label{eqn:nl}
      \delta_{x}(t) = \delta_{x}(0) e^{t}
    \end{equation}
  }

  \qitem Using the solution for $\delta_{x}(t),$ what is the new linearized approximation for $x(t)?$ Is this approximation valid for all values of $t?$

  \meta {
    Remember that linearization is an approximation to a system as well, and some linearizations are considered stable, meaning that it will be accurate for all values of $t$ whereas some will be unstable, meaning they only work in a small neighborhood around $x^{*}.$ 
  }

  \sol {
    We plug in our solution $\delta_{x}(t) = \delta_{x}(0) e^{t}$ to get $x(t) = x^{*} + \delta_{x}(0) e^{t}.$
    Note that for larger values of $t, \delta_{x}(0) e^{t}$ will blow up meaning this approximation will not be stable for large values of $t.$
  }
