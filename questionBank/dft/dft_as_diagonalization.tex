\qns{DFT as a basis for Diagonalization}

Looking at a DFT matrix, notice how the DFT matrix's columns could form a very nice basis.
In fact, a natural question to ask is what types of matrices can be diagonalized by the DFT?

\begin{enumerate}

\qitem
What's the following 
$\begin{bmatrix}


\end{bmatrix}$


\end{enumerate}
