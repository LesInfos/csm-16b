To motivate the DFT, imagine a scenario where you would like to analyze an important signal
(for example, a radio transmission from someone sending a message to you).
First, you periodically sample the incoming signal, collecting a total of $N$
points. Then, you put all of these samples into a vector $\vec{x}$. As we will show in this
problem, applying the DFT to this vector $\vec{x}$ will allow you to extract important information such as
the different frequencies that are present in the signal. In other words, applying the DFT to $N$ samples
of a time-domain signal gives us its frequency-domain representation, showing us how much of each frequency is in our signal.


The DFT matrix for a signal sampled at $N$ points is defined as follows:

\begin{align*}
F_N = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
1 & \omega_N^{-1} & \omega_N^{-2} & \cdots & \omega_N^{-(N-1)} \\
1 & \omega_N^{-2(1)} & \omega_N^{-2(2)} & \cdots & \omega_N^{-2(N-1)} \\
1 & \omega_N^{-3(1)} & \omega_N^{-3(2)} & \cdots & \omega_N^{-3(N-1)} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & \omega_N^{-(N-1)(1)} & \omega_N^{-(N-1)(2)} & \cdots & \omega_N^{-(N-1)(N-1)} \\
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{align*}

Recall that $\omega_N$ is the basis $N^{th}$ root of unity, defined as $\omega_N = e^{j\frac{2\pi}{N}}$.
