To motivate the DFT, imagine a scenario where you have an important signal that you would
like to analyze (for example, a radio transmission from someone sending a message to you).
Your first step is to sample the incoming signal at intervals, collecting a total of $N$
points. Then, you put all of these samples into a vector $\vec{x}$. As we will show in this
problem, applying the DFT to this vector will allow you to extract important information like
all of the frequencies that are present in the signal.

The DFT matrix for a signal sampled at $N$ points is defined as follows:

\begin{align*}
F_N = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
1 & \omega_N^{-1} & \omega_N^{-2} & \cdots & \omega_N^{-(N-1)} \\
1 & \omega_N^{-2(1)} & \omega_N^{-2(2)} & \cdots & \omega_N^{-2(N-1)} \\
1 & \omega_N^{-3(1)} & \omega_N^{-3(2)} & \cdots & \omega_N^{-3(N-1)} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & \omega_N^{-(N-1)(1)} & \omega_N^{-(N-1)(2)} & \cdots & \omega_N^{-(N-1)(N-1)} \\
\end{bmatrix} 
\end{align*}

Recall that $\omega_N$ is the basis $N$th root of unity, defined as $\omega_N = e^{j\frac{2\pi}{N}}$.
